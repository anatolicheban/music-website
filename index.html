                  Imagine, you turn on Netflix and find series of 7 episodes
                  called “ The Sound Healing Practice” The description says:
                  “Procude sound! Sing! If your singing is clean, it means that
                  you are have the right hertz! However, if it’s not clean, it
                  means your life’s not clean either. You know that everything
                  is interconnected. Being able to sing the right way and keep
                  up with the rhythm, you can turn your life to be as
                  rhythmical! This happens because everything in this universe
                  is the rhythm pulsation.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you still do not sound clean and cannot keep up with the
                  rhythm, these Netflix series are just for you!” Watching this
                  TV show , we will be singing 7 mantras in 7 keys to unblock
                  and activate 7 chakras of our body. I likewise added my
                  personal perk that includes playing on 7 different flutes to
                  make this wonderful experience even more colorful. How is this
                  going to happen? Special for this unique project, we
                  (professional music team) composed 7 unique tracks, where we
                  adapted Indian mantras to today’s sounds. It comprises
                  harmonies, simple piano chords accompanied by Indian
                  monotonous tampuras. Let’s sound!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  1. A guide! Before practicing, we always sing the “OM” three
                  times. For those who are new to mantras, man is mind, an atra
                  is cleansing. Therefore, “mantra” means the cleansing of mind!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  2. During each episode, we will be singing just like in
                  karaoke. I sing first — you listen and memorize. Then, you
                  repeat (sing) yourselves. For your convenience, there will be
                  lyrics on the screen.

                  Imagine, you turn on Netflix and find series of 7 episodes
                  called “ The Sound Healing Practice” The description says:
                  “Procude sound! Sing! If your singing is clean, it means that
                  you are have the right hertz! However, if it’s not clean, it
                  means your life’s not clean either. You know that everything
                  is interconnected. Being able to sing the right way and keep
                  up with the rhythm, you can turn your life to be as
                  rhythmical! This happens because everything in this universe
                  is the rhythm pulsation.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you still do not sound clean and cannot keep up with the
                  rhythm, these Netflix series are just for you!” Watching this
                  TV show , we will be singing 7 mantras in 7 keys to unblock
                  and activate 7 chakras of our body. I likewise added my
                  personal perk that includes playing on 7 different flutes to
                  make this wonderful experience even more colorful. How is this
                  going to happen? Special for this unique project, we
                  (professional music team) composed 7 unique tracks, where we
                  adapted Indian mantras to today’s sounds. It comprises
                  harmonies, simple piano chords accompanied by Indian
                  monotonous tampuras. Let’s sound!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  1. A guide! Before practicing, we always sing the “OM” three
                  times. For those who are new to mantras, man is mind, an atra
                  is cleansing. Therefore, “mantra” means the cleansing of mind!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  2. During each episode, we will be singing just like in
                  karaoke. I sing first — you listen and memorize. Then, you
                  repeat (sing) yourselves. For your convenience, there will be
                  lyrics on the screen.

                  TV show , we will be singing 7 mantras in 7 keys to unblock
                  and activate 7 chakras of our body. I likewise added my
                  personal perk that includes playing on 7 different flutes to
                  make this wonderful experience even more colorful. How is this
                  going to happen? Special for this unique project, we
                  (professional music team) composed 7 unique tracks, where we
                  adapted Indian mantras to today’s sounds. It comprises
                  harmonies, simple piano chords accompanied by Indian
                  monotonous tampuras. Let’s sound!

                  1. A guide! Before practicing, we always sing the “OM” three
                  times. For those who are new to mantras, man is mind, an atra
                  is cleansing. Therefore, “mantra” means the cleansing of mind!

                  <br />
                  2. During each episode, we will be singing just like in
                  karaoke. I sing first — you listen and memorize. Then, you
                  repeat (sing) yourselves. For your convenience, there will be
                  lyrics on the screen.
